# *chirps*: API Client for CHIRPS and CHIRTS <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

## Overview

**chirps** provides the API Client for the Climate Hazards Center 'CHIRPS' and 'CHIRTS'. The 'CHIRPS' data is a quasi-global (50°S – 50°N) high-resolution (0.05 arc-degrees) rainfall data set, which incorporates satellite imagery 
  and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. 'CHIRTS' is a quasi-global (60°S – 70°N), high-resolution data set of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. For more details on 'CHIRPS' and 'CHIRTS' data please visit its official home page <https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data>.

## Quick start

### From CRAN

The stable version is available through CRAN.

```r
install.packages("chirps")
```

### From GitHub

A development version that may have new features or bug fixes is available through GitHub.

``` r
library("remotes")

install_github("ropensci/chirps", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

Fetch CHIRPS data from three points across the *Tapajós* National Forest (Brazil) from in Jan-2017. The default procedure will download the COG files from the CHIRPS server and handle it internally using the package `terra`. This is more interesting when dealing with hundreds of points and days. Data can be returned as a matrix using the argument `as.matrix = TRUE`.

```r
library("chirps")

lonlat <- data.frame(lon = c(-55.0281,-54.9857, -55.0714),
                     lat = c(-2.8094, -2.8756, -3.5279))

dates <- c("2017-01-01", "2017-01-31")

dat <- get_chirps(lonlat, dates, server = "CHC", as.matrix = FALSE)

```

For a faster download of few datapoints (~ 10 datapoints), the argument `server = "ClimateSERV"` can be used  

```r
library("chirps")

lonlat <- data.frame(lon = c(-55.0281,-54.9857, -55.0714),
                     lat = c(-2.8094, -2.8756, -3.5279))

dates <- c("2017-01-01", "2017-01-31")

dat <- get_chirps(lonlat, dates, server = "ClimateSERV", as.matrix = FALSE)

```

## Going further

The full functionality of **chirps** is illustrated in the package vignette. The vignette can be found on the [package website](https://docs.ropensci.org/chirps/) or from within `R` once the package has been installed, e.g. via: 

``` r
vignette("Overview", package = "chirps")
```
