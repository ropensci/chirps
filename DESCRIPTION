Description: API Client for the Climate Hazards Center 'CHIRPS' and
    'CHIRTS'.  The 'CHIRPS' data is a quasi-global (50°S – 50°N)
    high-resolution (0.05 arc-degrees) rainfall data set, which
    incorporates satellite imagery and in-situ station data to create
    gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought
    monitoring. 'CHIRTS' is a quasi-global (60°S – 70°N), high-resolution
    data set of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. For more details
    on 'CHIRPS' and 'CHIRTS' data please visit its official home page
    <https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data>.
